**Abstract**

ImageNet-1K serves as the primary dataset for pretraining deep learning models for computer vision tasks. ImageNet-21K dataset, which contains more pictures and classes, is used less frequently for pretraining, mainly due to its complexity, and underestimation of its added value compared to standard ImageNet-1K pretraining.
This paper aims to close this gap, and make high-quality efficient pretraining on ImageNet-21K available for everyone.
Via a dedicated preprocessing stage, utilizing WordNet hierarchies, and a novel training scheme called semantic softmax, we show that different models, including small mobile-oriented models, significantly benefit from ImageNet-21K pretraining on numerous datasets and tasks.
We also show that we outperform previous ImageNet-21K pretraining schemes for prominent new models like ViT.
Our proposed pretraining pipeline is efficient, accessible, and leads to SoTA reproducible results, from a publicly available dataset.

## 29/11/2021 Update - New article released, offering new classification head with state-of-the-art results
Checkout our new project, [Ml-Decoder](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ML_Decoder), which presents a unified classification head for multi-label, single-label and
zero-shot tasks. Backbones with ML-Decoder reach SOTA results, while also improving speed-accuracy tradeoff.

<!--## 05/08/2021 Update - Training From Random Initilization Script Released-->
<!--We release the following [script](./train_single_label_from_scratch.py), that reproduces the article results with random initialization, instead of initalizing from ImageNet-1K. The only change is that 140 epochs of training are needed, instead of 80, and we use SGD optimizer with a higher learning rate.-->
<!--We still recommend initializing your models from standard ImageNet-1K pretraining to reduce training times and save rainforests.-->

<!--Note that we also released a new version of the article in arxiv, with additional interesting ablation tests. For example - comparison to Open Images pretraining, and more-->
<!--comparisons on non-classification tasks. Thanks to Matan Karklinsky for his help with Inria-holidays dataset.-->

## Getting Started

### (0) Visualization and Inference Script
First you can play and do inference on dedicated images using the following [script](./visualize_detector.py).

We highly recommend to start working with ImageNet-21K by testing these weights against standard ImageNet-1K pretraining, and comparing results on your relevant downstream tasks.
After you will see a significant improvement, proceed to pretraining new models.

Note that some of our models, with 21K and 1K pretraining, are also avaialbe via the excellent [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) package:
```
21K:
model = timm.create_model('mobilenetv3_large_100_miil_in21k', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('tresnet_m_miil_in21k', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('vit_base_patch16_224_miil_in21k', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('mixer_b16_224_miil_in21k', pretrained=True)


1K:
model = timm.create_model('mobilenetv3_large_100_miil', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('tresnet_m', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('vit_base_patch16_224_miil', pretrained=True)
model = timm.create_model('mixer_b16_224_miil', pretrained=True)
```
Using this [link](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/master/results/results-imagenet.csv) you can make sure we indeed reach the reported accuracies in the article.

### (2) Obtaining and Processing the Dataset
See instructions for obtaining and processing the dataset in [here](./dataset_preprocessing/processing_instructions.md).


### (3) Training Code
To use the training code, first download the relevant ImageNet-21K-P semantic tree file to your local ./resources/ folder:
- fall11 [semantic tree](https://miil-public-eu.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/model-zoo/ImageNet_21K_P/resources/fall11/imagenet21k_miil_tree.pth)
- winter21 [semantic tree](https://miil-public-eu.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/model-zoo/ImageNet_21K_P/resources/winter21/imagenet21k_miil_tree.pth)



Example of semantic softmax training:
```
python train_semantic_softmax.py \
--batch_size=4 \
--data_path=/mnt/datasets/21k \
--model_name=mobilenetv3_large_100 \
--model_path=/mnt/models/mobilenetv3_large_100.pth \
--epochs=80
```
For shortening the training, we initialize the weights from standard ImageNet-1K. Recommended to use ImageNet-1K weights from timm [repo](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models).

### (4) Transfer Learning Code
See [here](Transfer_learning.md) for reproduction code, that show how miil pretraining not only improves transfer learning results, but also makes MLP models more stable and robust for hyper-parameters selection.

## Additional SoTA results
The results in the article are comparative results, with fixed hyper-parameters.
In addition, using our pretrained models, and a dedicated training scheme with adjusted hyper-parameters per dataset (resolution, optimizer, learning rate), we were able
to achieve SoTA results on several computer vision dataset - MS-COCO, Pascal-VOC, Stanford Cars and CIFAR-100.

We will share our models' checkpoints to validate our scores.
